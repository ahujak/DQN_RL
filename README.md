# DQN_RL
In this project, we implement DQN to play games from Open AI gym. We implement three different games. 

Lunarlander_box2d.ipynb: Lunar lander game (8 dimensional state vector as input)

Pong_Ram.ipynb: RAM version of Pong game (128 dimensional state vector as input)

Pong_screen.ipynb: Screen version of Pong game (210* 160* 3 image as input)

To view the sample-videos in the Python notebooks open the files in Google Colab.
